# Programming Lessons Checklist

Shortly after I started learning Ruby, my primary instructor created a master list of 77 things I needed to know before I could call myself a Ruby Developer.

He broke the list down into seven categories:

## Ruby --

The largest section of the list, of course, dealt with Ruby and its main tools. To date, I've marked off most of that list.
Included on the list are tools, such as 'pry', 'ri', RubyGems and the standard library. 

I started out with basic if-else statements and loops, before moving up to methods and method arguments. Around the same time, I was introduced to basic iterators, like 'each' and 'sample'. 

Eventually, I covered classes, instance variables, and blocks.

Along the way, I was rewriting the same few projects with each new set of tools, with the goal in mind of making the code simultaneously shorter, and more readable.

Around the time I covered class objects, I began getting access to encapsulation.

My largest project to date, a still-unfinished text-adventure game I call Tales of Bardorba, introduced me to project layout and, inheritance, and managing a significant number of objects at the same time.

Over the last month, I've been doing less core Ruby, because I've been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery so that I can interface with the front end. I did find time to learn Ruby's regular expression interface (very fun), read up on Github's Ruby code style guide (that'll be a blog post on its own) and duck typing. Polymorphism is my new favorite thing.

I've covered DSL's a little bit, but not enough to pretend I really understand it, and I'm going to get around to metaprogramming soon.
