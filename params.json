(Something something programming.)","body":"# Hello world\r\n\r\nThis blog is dedicated to documenting my progress in becoming a Ruby developer. \r\n\r\nSince August of 2015, I've been working my way through programming in general, and Ruby in particular. When I started, I had no experience with coding, and very little experience with the command line interface. Fortunately, I had very good teachers. \r\n\r\n## Topics \r\nI'd like to cover at least some of in the following topics in the short-term...\r\n* Navigating Linux as a newbie\r\n* Markdown\r\n* VIM tricks and tips\r\n* Programming Lessons check-list\r\n* My take on Agile\r\n* Regular Expressions\r\n* Learning it the hard way first\r\n* Learning to code through projects\r\n* Navigating projects with a significant number of objects\r\n* Javascript and JQuery\r\n* HTML and CSS\r\n* What relevant books I've been reading\r\n* Listening my way through the [Ruby Rogues Podcast](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/)\r\n* Polymorphism and Duck Typing\r\n* Naming classes and methods\r\n\r\nI have no idea what order I'm going to cover these in, and I'll come up with other topics before I get to all of them. That said, I like to write and I have a new interface to play with, so expect fairly robust output for a while.\r\n\r\nCurrent Posts\r\n\r\n[Programming Lessons](_posts/2015-04-29-lessons.md)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
